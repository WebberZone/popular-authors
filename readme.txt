Show a list of the popular authors using the widget or shortcode. A Top 10 WordPress plugin addon.

== Description ==

[Popular Authors WordPress plugin](https://webberzone.com/downloads/popular-authors/) is an addon for [Top 10](https://webberzone.com/plugins/top-10/) that allows you display the top authors on your blog by page views.

The most popular authors can be displayed using either the shortcode or via the inbuilt widget. You can also use the function `wzpa_list_popular_authors()` to display popular authors programmatically.

= Features =

* Multi-widget capable: You can have several widgets of Popular Authors each with its own settings
* Custom Time Range: List popular authors within a specific time range (eg. last 1 day, last 7 days, last 30 days, etc.)
* Shortcode: Use the `[wzpa_popular_authors]` shortcode to display your most popular authors
* Template tags: Use `wzpa_list_popular_authors()` to display the popular authors programmatically
