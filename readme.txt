Discover and appreciate your blog’s most popular authors, a simple and powerful addon for Top 10 - Popular Posts for WordPress.

== Description ==

[Popular Authors WordPress plugin](https://webberzone.com/downloads/popular-authors/) is the ultimate addon for [Top 10](https://webberzone.com/plugins/top-10/), the best plugin to showcase your most popular posts on WordPress. With Popular Authors, you can also highlight the top authors on your blog by page views and give them the recognition they deserve.

Popular Authors lets you display the most popular authors using different methods. You can use the Gutenberg block, the shortcode, the widget or the template tag to insert the popular authors list anywhere on your site. You can also customize the appearance and settings of each method to suit your needs.

Popular Authors also gives you the flexibility to choose the time range for calculating the page views. You can show the popular authors of all time, or limit it to a specific period, such as last day, last week, last month, etc. This way, you can keep your popular authors list fresh and dynamic.

Popular Authors is a must-have addon for Top 10 if you want to boost your blog's engagement and credibility. By showcasing your most popular authors, you can attract more readers, increase social shares, and build a loyal community around your blog.
